# Build the Open Network Loader ISO. 
#
# This build target is designed for Loader development and testing. 
# 
# - The loader image is built from source directly (not the debian package). 
# - The hda image is blank (no integrated SWI). 
#
# How to run:
# > kvm -m 1024 -cdrom loader-i386.iso -boot d -nographic -hda hda.img

#
# We inherit the Makefile.comp from the i386/loader build, but specify that
# we should use a custom initrd build rather than the default, which is
# to pull it from the repo. 
#
# The assumption is that you are building this target because you are 
# doing generic loader development, and rebuilds from source are
# what you want.
