Open Networking Linux has started to add support for various packet fowarding agents.

Currently, ONL supports the Open Route Cache (ORC).  More information about ORC
can be found in its source code, under $ONL/submodules/bigcode/modules/orc.  
If the code does not yet exist there, use `cd $ONL && git submodule update --init submodules/bigcode`.
