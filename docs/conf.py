# --- Options for Latex Output ---

# latex_documents
#This value determines how to group the document tree into LaTeX
#source files. It must be a list of tuples (startdocname, targetname,
#title, author, documentclass, toctree_only), where the items are:
#
#  startdocname: document name that is the “root” of the LaTeX file. All
#  documents referenced by it in TOC trees will be included in the LaTeX
#  file too. (If you want only one LaTeX file, use your master_doc
#  here.)
#
#  targetname: file name of the LaTeX file in the output directory.
#
#  title: LaTeX document title. Can be empty to use the title of the
#  startdoc. This is inserted as LaTeX markup, so special characters
#  like a backslash or ampersand must be represented by the proper LaTeX
#  commands if they are to be inserted literally.
#
#  author: Author for the LaTeX document. The same LaTeX markup caveat
#  as for title applies. Use \and to separate multiple authors, as in:
#  'John \and Sarah'.
#
#  documentclass: Normally, one of 'manual' or 'howto' (provided by
#  Sphinx). Other document classes can be given, but they must include
#  the “sphinx” package in order to define Sphinx’ custom LaTeX
#  commands. “howto” documents will not get appendices. Also, howtos
#  will have a simpler title page.
#
#  toctree_only: Must be True or False. If True, the startdoc document
#  itself is not included in the output, only the documents referenced
#  by it via TOC trees. With this option, you can put extra stuff in the
#  master document that shows up in the HTML, but not the LaTeX output.
#
#New in version 0.3: The 6th item toctree_only. Tuples with 5 items are still accepted.

latex_documents = [
    ('index', u'Open_Network_Install_Environment.tex',
     u'Open Network Install Environment', u'Author Name',
     'howto', False),
]

# latex_logo
#If given, this must be the name of an image file (relative to the
#configuration directory) that is the logo of the docs. It is placed
#at the top of the title page. Default: None.

# latex_use_parts
#If true, the topmost sectioning unit is parts, else it is
#chapters. Default: False.

# latex_appendices
# A list of document names to append as an appendix to all manuals.

# latex_domain_indices
#If true, generate domain-specific indices in addition to the general
#index. For e.g. the Python domain, this is the global module
#index. Default is True.
#
#This value can be a bool or a list of index names that should be
#generated, like for html_domain_indices.

# latex_show_pagerefs
#If true, add page references after internal references. This is very
#useful for printed copies of the manual. Default is False.

# latex_show_urls

#Control whether to display URL addresses. This is very useful for
#printed copies of the manual. The setting can have the following
#values:
#
#  'no' – do not display URLs (default)
#  'footnote' – display URLs in footnotes
#  'inline' – display URLs inline in parentheses
#
# Changed in version 1.1: This value is now a string; previously it
# was a boolean value, and a true value selected the 'inline'
# display. For backwards compatibility, True is still accepted.

# latex_elements
#New in version 0.5.
#
#A dictionary that contains LaTeX snippets that override those Sphinx
#usually puts into the generated .tex files.
#
#Keep in mind that backslashes must be doubled in Python string
#literals to avoid interpretation as escape sequences.
#
#Keys that you may want to override include:
#
#'papersize'
#Paper size option of the document class ('a4paper' or 'letterpaper'),
#default 'letterpaper'.
#
#'pointsize'
#Point size option of the document class ('10pt', '11pt' or '12pt'),
#default '10pt'.
#
#'babel'
#“babel” package inclusion, default '\\usepackage{babel}'.
#
#'fontpkg'
#Font package inclusion, default '\\usepackage{times}' (which uses
#Times and Helvetica). You can set this to '' to use the Computer
#Modern fonts.
#
#'fncychap'
#Inclusion of the “fncychap” package (which makes fancy chapter
#titles), default '\\usepackage[Bjarne]{fncychap}' for English
#documentation, '\\usepackage[Sonny]{fncychap}' for internationalized
#docs (because the “Bjarne” style uses numbers spelled out in
#English). Other “fncychap” styles you can try include “Lenny”,
#“Glenn”, “Conny” and “Rejne”. You can also set this to '' to disable
#fncychap.
#
#'preamble'
#Additional preamble content, default empty.
#
#'footer'`
#Additional footer content (before the indices), default empty.
#
#Keys that don’t need be overridden unless in special cases are:
#
#'inputenc'
#“inputenc” package inclusion, default '\\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}'.
#
#'fontenc'
#“fontenc” package inclusion, default '\\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}'.
#
#'maketitle'
#“maketitle” call, default '\\maketitle'. Override if you want to
#generate a differently-styled title page.
#
#'tableofcontents'
#“tableofcontents” call, default '\\tableofcontents'. Override if you
#want to generate a different table of contents or put content between
#the title page and the TOC.
#
#'printindex'
#“printindex” call, the last thing in the file, default
#'\\printindex'. Override if you want to generate the index
#differently or append some content after the index.
#
#Keys that are set by other options and therefore should not be
#overridden are:
#
#  'docclass' 'classoptions' 'title' 'date' 'release' 'author' 'logo'
#  'releasename' 'makeindex' 'shorthandoff'

# latex_docclass
#A dictionary mapping 'howto' and 'manual' to names of real document
#classes that will be used as the base for the two Sphinx
#classes. Default is to use 'article' for 'howto' and 'report' for
#'manual'.

# latex_additional_files
#A list of file names, relative to the configuration directory, to
#copy to the build directory when building LaTeX output. This is
#useful to copy files that Sphinx doesn’t copy automatically, e.g. if
#they are referenced in custom LaTeX added in latex_elements. Image
#files that are referenced in source files (e.g. via .. image::) are
#copied automatically.
#
#You have to make sure yourself that the filenames don’t collide with
#those of any automatically copied files.
