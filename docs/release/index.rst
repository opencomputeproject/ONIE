=========================
Source Code Release Cycle
=========================

- ONIE will be released (approximately) every 3 months.

- Under normal conditions, the release date will be a Wednesday around
  mid-month.

- Immediately following each release, there will be a "merge window"
  of normally 8 weeks.

- While this merge window is open, new features can be added to the
  ONIE source tree.

- After the merge window closes, no new features may be added.  This
  allows for a release candidate phase which is intended to fix bugs
  and regressions.  During this stabilization period, only patches
  that contain bug fixes get applied.

- After the merge window, the release cycle allows for about 4 weeks
  of testing before generating the next release.

.. note:: While we try to adhere to the release schedule, we will not
   hesitate to delay a release for good reasons.  The code will be
   released when it is considered ready without caring too much about the
   announced deadline.

Version Numbers
---------------

Starting with the release in November 2013, the names of the releases
changed from numerical release numbers into timestamp-based
numbering. Regular releases are identified by names consisting of the
calendar year and month of the release date.

Additional fields (if present) indicate release candidates or bug fix
releases in "stable" maintenance trees.
