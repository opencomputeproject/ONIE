************************************
Quick Start Guide -- ONIE By Example
************************************

ONIE supports a number of methods for locating a Network Operating
System (NOS) installer image.  The methods range from **really easy** to
**rather complex**.

The easy methods are suitable for installing an NOS on a small number
of switches as a proof of concept or for a demo.  These methods, while
easy to set up, offer limited configurable options that more complex
networks may require.

The more complex methods are suitable for complex networks and large
scale switch deployment scenarios.  These methods offer a wide range
of flexible options, with the downside being you need to understand
and configure these options.

.. note:: The examples throughout this section reference a
  hypothetical PowerPC-based switch, called **MACHINE**, manufactured by a
  hypothetical hardware manufacturer, called **VENDOR**.

Installing using a USB thumb drive
==================================

To install via USB simply copy the installer image to the *root*
directory of the USB thumb drive, using the file name
``onie-installer``.

For the purposes of this guide, assume the the NOS installer image is
named ``ACME_XYZ1234_PowerPC_Installer.bin``.  Let's assume the USB
drive shows up at /dev/sdd1 under Linux (it might be different on your
system and OS).

Copy the installer file to the root of the USB thumb drive like this::

  linux:~$ sudo mkdir /mnt/usb
  linux:~$ sudo mount /dev/sdd1 /mnt/usb
  linux:~$ sudo cp ACME_XYZ1234_PowerPC_Installer.bin /mnt/usb
  linux:~$ sudo umount /mnt/usb

Now remove the USB drive from your computer and insert it into the USB
port on the front (or rear) panel of your ONIE enabled device.  Power
on the device and ONIE will discover the ``onie-installer`` file on
the root of the USB drive and execute it.

Installing over the Network
===========================

For all network installation scenarios, ONIE expects the NOS installer
image to be available on the network via HTTP.  This guide assumes the
following hostname and IPv4 address of the Web server::

  hostname:  image-server
  IP addr :  203.0.113.10

Before continuing, the following resources must be set up:

- Install and configure an HTTP server.
- Copy the NOS installer image to the HTTP server.

Installing and Configuring the HTTP Server
------------------------------------------

Download and install your favorite HTTP server [#apache_httpd]_
[#thttpd]_.

The examples in this guide assume Apache httpd is installed on a Linux
machine with the default configuration options.  The document root of
the Web server is ``/var/www``.

Copying the NOS Installer Image to the HTTP Server
--------------------------------------------------

After procuring your NOS installer image from your NOS vendor, copy the
installer to the document root of your Web server.  In the case of
Apache on Linux, the document root directory is ``/var/www``.  You
probably need root privileges to copy files there.

For the purposes of this guide, assume the the NOS installer image is 
named ``ACME_XYZ1234_PowerPC_Installer.bin``.  After copying this file 
to the document root of the Web server, the contents of ``/var/www`` 
should look like this::

  image-server:~$ sudo cp ACME_XYZ1234_PowerPC_Installer.bin /var/www
  image-server:~$ ls -l /var/www
  -rw-r--r-- 1 root root  17755 Jun 27 16:18 ACME_XYZ1234_PowerPC_Installer.bin

.. _test_http_server:

Testing the NOS Installer Download from the HTTP Server
-------------------------------------------------------

Before proceeding, it is a good idea to double check the configuration
of the Web server and the location of the NOS installer image.  From
another machine, try to download the NOS installer image.  You could
use a Web browser or a CLI command like ``wget`` ([#wget]_) or ``curl`` 
([#curl]_).

The URLs to double check are::

  http://203.0.113.10/ACME_XYZ1234_PowerPC_Installer.bin
  http://image-server/ACME_XYZ1234_PowerPC_Installer.bin

.. _directly_connected:

Directly Connected Scenario
===========================

The most simple topology is when the Web server is directly connected
to the Ethernet management port on the target switch, as depicted in the 
following diagram.

.. figure:: direct-connect.png
  :scale: 75
  :align: center
  :alt: Switch and Web Server Directly Connected

This simple configuration is appropriate for provisioning a small
number of switches without relying on a lot of infrastructure.  You
might have this scenario in a production environment when you wheel a
crash cart up to a switch in a rack and need to perform a quick
one-off install.

In this scenario, without any additional configuration, ONIE will
discover the IP address (either IPv6 or IPv4) of the link local Web
server.  See the :ref:`discover_neighbors` section for more on how
ONIE discovers its link local neighbors.

After neighbor discovery, ONIE makes HTTP requests for a series of
default installer image file names as described in
:ref:`default_file_name`.

Next, ONIE applies the default file name conventions, then it makes 
the following HTTP requests looking for an installer image::

  http://203.0.113.10/onie-installer-powerpc-VENDOR_MACHINE-r0
  http://203.0.113.10/onie-installer-powerpc-VENDOR_MACHINE
  http://203.0.113.10/onie-installer-VENDOR_MACHINE
  http://203.0.113.10/onie-installer-powerpc
  http://203.0.113.10/onie-installer

.. note:: For the exact file names used for your specific hardware
          platform please contact your NOS vendor or your hardware
          vendor.

A simple way to configure the Web server is to symlink (or rename) the
NOS vendor's image name to one of the default ONIE installer file
names.  The symlink technique is shown here::

  image-server:~$ cd /var/www
  image-server:/var/www$ sudo ln -s ACME_XYZ1234_PowerPC_Installer.bin ./onie-installer
  image-server:/var/www$ ls -l 
  lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  104 Jul 22 14:01 onie-installer -> ACME_XYZ1234_PowerPC_Installer.bin

With the symlink in place, the Web server hands back the full
installer image in response to the request for ``onie-installer``.
Now ONIE can download and run the installer image.

L2 Connected  Scenario
======================

In this topology, the target switch and the Web server are both in the
same layer 2 network. For example, they might both be plugged into the
same unmanaged switch. This is depicted in the following diagram.

.. figure:: l2-connect.png
  :scale: 75
  :align: center
  :alt: Switch and Web Server on Same L2 Network

This scenario proceeds just like the :ref:`directly_connected`
described previously.  ONIE discovers the IP address of the Web server
and tries to download a series of default file names from the server.

.. _basic_dhcp_1:

Basic DHCP Scenario 1 (Specify Installer Image URL)
===================================================

In this scenario we jump up one level in sophistication and use a DHCP
server to provide more specific information about the location of the
installer image.  The DHCP server, target switch and Web server are
all located on the same layer 2 network.  This is depicted in the
following diagram.

.. figure:: dhcp.png
  :scale: 75
  :align: center
  :alt: Switch and Web Server on Same L2 Network with DHCP Server

The DHCP server provides the following information:

- IP address for the target switch from a pool of IP addresses
- URL of the installer image on the Web server

Below is a sample from a ``dhcpd.conf`` file for an ISC DHCP server
[#isc_dhcp]_ [#isc_dhcp_options]_.  For more information on how ONIE 
uses DHCP options, see the :ref:`onie_dhcp_requests` section::

  subnet 203.0.113.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
    range 203.0.113.20 203.0.113.200;
    option default-url = "http://203.0.113.10/customer-abc-onie-installer";
  }

With this configuration ONIE picks up an IP address from the pool
defined by the ``range`` parameter.  ONIE next attempts to download
the URL specified by the ``default-url`` parameter.

With this technique you can:

- Assign whatever IP addresses make sense for your network.
- Name the installer image whatever you want, including
  sub-directories.

.. note:: In this example the Web server and target switch must be on
          the same layer 2 network.

.. _basic_dhcp_2:

Basic DHCP Scenario 2 (Domain Name Server)
==========================================

This scenario is just like :ref:`basic_dhcp_1` with the addition of a
domain name server (DNS).  By introducing a domain name server you can
use logical names for the Web server, without using hard-coded IP
addresses.

To add support for DNS, specify the ``domain-name-servers`` DHCP
option in the ``dhcpd.conf`` file::

  subnet 203.0.113.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
    range 203.0.113.20 203.0.113.200;
    option domain-name-servers 203.0.113.2; 
    option default-url = "http://image-server/customer-abc-onie-installer";
  }

The domain name server is 203.0.113.2.  ONIE uses this server to
resolve the IP address for the hostname ``image-server``.

Layer 3 Network Scenario
========================

This scenario picks up where the :ref:`basic_dhcp_2` left off and adds
router information to the DHCP configuration.  In this scenario the
target switch traverses a layer 3 network via a gateway to reach the
Web server.  The network topology is shown in the following diagram.

.. figure:: l3-connect.png
  :scale: 75
  :align: center
  :alt: Switch and Web Server on Different L3 Networks with DHCP Server

With this setup, the Web server and target switch can reside on
different subnets.  The target switch needs to send packets via a
router to reach the Web server, since the machines are on different
subnets.

To specify a router for the target switch, in the DHCP configuration, set
the ``routers`` option to the IP address of the router::

  subnet 203.0.113.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
    range 203.0.113.20 203.0.113.200;
    option domain-name-servers 203.0.113.2; 
    option routers 203.0.113.3; 
    option default-url = "http://image-server/customer-abc-onie-installer";
  }

When requesting the installer image, the target switch sends packets to
203.0.113.3, which then forwards the packets to the next hop in the
layer 3 network.  Ultimately the packets reach the Web server and it
replies with the installer image.

.. note:: For this scenario, the DHCP server must be in the same layer
          2 network as the target switch.  The Web server is free to
          reside in any subnet reachable by the router.

.. note:: You can use BOOTP relay agents [#bootp_relay]_ to locate your
          DHCP server on a different layer 2 network.  Configuration
          of BOOTP realy agents is beyond the scope of this document.

.. _dhcp_debug:

Advanced DHCP (Match Vendor Class Identifier)
=============================================

When ONIE makes a DHCP request, it sets the DHCP vendor class
(option 60) to a particular string.  See :ref:`onie_dhcp_vendor_class` 
for more on how the DHCP vendor class is set.  Using our example 
PowerPC machine, the string would be::

  onie_vendor:powerpc-VENDOR_MACHINE-r0

.. note:: For the exact DHCP Vendor Class Identifier used for your
          specific hardware platform please contact your NOS vendor or
          your hardware vendor.

The ISC DHCP server configuration file syntax contains basic string
matching functionality that we can use to identify ONIE DHCP requests.
By parsing this string, an appropriate image URL can be returned by the
``default-url`` DHCP option [#dhcp_eval]_ [#dhcp_options]_.

The following DHCP stanzas differentiate between PowerPC ONIE-enabled
switches from example vendors **VendorX** and **VendorY**::

  class "onie-vendor-X-class" {
    match if substring(option vendor-class-identifier, 0, 27) = "onie_vendor:powerpc-VendorX";
    option default-url = "http://image-server/VendorX-onie-installer";
  }

  class "onie-vendor-Y-class" {
    match if substring(option vendor-class-identifier, 0, 27) = "onie_vendor:powerpc-VendorY";
    option default-url = "http://image-server/VendorY-onie-installer";
  }

In this case the DHCP server hands back different URLs depending on
the ``vendor-class-identifier`` option.

.. note:: When debugging such constructs you may find it useful to
          sprinkle in some DHCP logging directives.  For example, the
          following ``log()`` directive placed **outside** the class stanza
          can help you understand what is going on::

            log(error, concat("vendor-class: ", substring(option vendor-class-identifier, 0, 11)));
            log(error, concat("platform    : ", substring(option vendor-class-identifier, 12, 999)));

          The first ``log()`` displays the first 11 characters of the
          ``vendor-class-identifier``, which should be the string
          ``onie_vendor``.  The 2nd ``log()`` displays the remaining
          characters.

          Once everything is working you can remove the logging.

Advanced DHCP 2 (VIVSO)
=======================

As an alternative to string matching on the ``vendor-class-identifier``,
ONIE also sends a Vendor-Identifying Vendor-Specific Information
Option (VIVSO - DHCP option 125) [#dhcp_options]_.

The VIVSO method is a more precise method of identifying the target
switch, however, this method also requires a bit more configuration on
the DHCP server.

For more information on how ONIE uses VIVSO, see :ref:`dhcp_vivso`. Read 
that now if you are interested in using VIVSO. (I mean it, go
now; we will wait for you to get back.)

The VIVSO option is bi-directional -- the ONIE DHCP client sends the
option with identifying fields set and the DHCP server responds with
the URL field set.

VIVSO is nothing more than encapsulating vendor specific options
inside a standard DHCP option (option 125) [#rfc_3925]_.

In order for the ISC DHCP server to parse option 125, we have to define
the fields and data types to use.  Here is a snippet of the ISC DHCP server
configuration defining the fields that ONIE uses::

  # Create an option namespace called ONIE
  option space onie code width 1 length width 1;

  # Define the code names and data types within the ONIE namespace
  option onie.installer_url code 1 = text;
  option onie.updater_url   code 2 = text;
  option onie.machine       code 3 = text;
  option onie.arch          code 4 = text;
  option onie.machine_rev   code 5 = text;
   
  # Package the ONIE namespace into option 125
  option space vivso code width 4 length width 1;
  option vivso.onie code 42623 = encapsulate onie;
  option vivso.iana code 0 = string;
  option op125 code 125 = encapsulate vivso;

*I told you this method required more configuration...*

The number 42623 is a 32-bit IANA Enterprise Number used by ONIE to
identify its name space [#iana_number]_.  Since VIVSO allows for
multiple sets of vendor specific options, each set of options must be
uniquely identified by a IANA enterprise number.

The option space configuration should go into the ``dhcpd.conf`` file
at the **global** level, outside of any class definitions.

Now, with the option space defined, we can use the definitions when
receiving a VIVSO option.  Here is a snippet using the option space
definitions to inspect the target switch architecture and machine
type::

  class "onie-vendor-classes" {
    # Limit the matching to a request we know originated from ONIE
    match if substring(option vendor-class-identifier, 0, 11) = "onie_vendor";
   
    # Required to use VIVSO
    option vivso.iana 01:01:01;

    # generic CPU architecture matching
    if option onie.arch = "powerpc" {
      option onie.installer_url = "http://image-server/generic-powerpc-onie-installer";
    }

    # matching on CPU architecture and machine type
    if option onie.arch = "powerpc" and option onie.machine = "XYZ1234" {
      option onie.installer_url = "http://image-server/powerpc-xyz1234-onie-installer";
    }

    # The contents of an option can also be used to create the response text
    if exists onie.arch and exists onie.machine and exists onie.machine_rev {
      option onie.installer_url = concat("http://image-server/image-installer-",
                                       option onie.arch, "-", option onie.machine,
                                       "-r", option onie.machine_rev);
    }

    # When operating in ONIE 'update' mode ONIE will check the
    # onie.updater_url response option
    if option onie.arch = "powerpc" and option onie.machine = "XYZ1234" {
      option onie.updater_url = "http://image-server/onie-updater-VENDOR_XYZ1234-powerpc.bin";
    }
   
  }

Whew!  Let's go through this configuration and discuss what they mean.
First the ``class`` definition::

  class "onie-vendor-classes" {
    # Limit the matching to a request we know originated from ONIE
    match if substring(option vendor-class-identifier, 0, 11) = "onie_vendor";

The idea here is to limit the subsequent matching to a request we know
originated from an ONIE-enabled machine.  This is really just a bit of
healthy paranoia.

Next, the ``iana`` option::

    # Required to use VIVSO
    option vivso.iana 01:01:01;

This along with the option space ``vivso`` defined above is a workaround 
to a known issue in ISC DHCP server.  Without this workaround, the server 
will not send back an option 125 response [#vivso_workaround]_.

Next, the generic CPU architecture matching statement::

    # generic CPU architecture matching
    if option onie.arch = "powerpc" {
      option onie.installer_url = "http://image-server/generic-powerpc-onie-installer";
    }

This is an example of comparing an option field to a string.  If the
string matches, then the ``installer_url`` in the response is set to the
specified string.

Next, using the request field values in the response field values::

    # The contents of an option can also be used to create the response text
    if exists onie.arch and exists onie.machine and exists onie.machine_rev {
      option onie.installer_url = concat("http://image-server/image-installer-",
                                       option onie.arch, "-", option onie.machine,
                                       "-r", option onie.machine_rev);
    }

Using the function ``concat`` you can piece together several strings
to form the fields of the response.  Use the ``option`` directive to
extract the strings from the request and use the results to create the
response.

For example in the above snippet assume ``onie.arch = "powerpc"``,
``onie.machine = "XYZ1234"`` and ``onie.machine_rev = "2"``. In this case,
``onie.installer_url`` would be set to::

  onie.installer_url = "http://image-server/image-installer-powerpc-XYZ1234-r2"

Finally, let's look at the ``updater_url`` field::

    # When operating in ONIE 'update' mode ONIE will check the
    # onie.updater_url response option
    if option onie.arch = "powerpc" and option onie.machine = "XYZ1234" {
      option onie.updater_url = "http://image-server/onie-updater-VENDOR_XYZ1234-powerpc.bin";
    }

ONIE can run in *self-update mode* where it looks for an ONIE update
URL.  The update URL is used to download an ONIE self-update binary,
which ONIE uses to update itself.

Everything we have discussed about installer image URLs applies to
ONIE updater URLs when ONIE runs in self-update mode.

See :ref:`updating_onie` for more about ONIE self-update mode.

HTTP Headers and Scripting
==========================

When ONIE makes an HTTP request for an image a number of ONIE-specific
HTTP headers are sent.  The values of these headers could be used in
advanced deployments to taylor the provisioning.  The following
headers are set::

  ONIE-SERIAL-NUMBER:
  ONIE-ETH-ADDR:
  ONIE-VENDOR-ID:
  ONIE-MACHINE:
  ONIE-MACHINE-REV:
  ONIE-ARCH:
  ONIE-SECURITY-KEY:
  ONIE-OPERATION:

See :ref:`http_headers` for more about these HTTP headers.

For exmaple, the image URL handed out by the DHPC server could be a
CGI script on the HTTP server.  The CGI script could use the headers,
like ``ONIE-SERIAL-NUMBER`` and ``ONIE-ETH-ADDR``, to tie the
deployment together with an inventory control database.

Debugging an Installation
=========================

If you are having trouble with an ONIE based installation, here are a
few suggestions.

Verify Web Server Configuration
-------------------------------

Are you able to download the image from the Web server using a Web
browser?  See :ref:`test_http_server`.

Try Direct Connection
---------------------

Try connecting the Web server directly to the target switch as
described in :ref:`directly_connected`.

Inspect DHCP Server Logs
------------------------

Try adding some logging to your DHCP server configuration as described
in :ref:`dhcp_debug`.

Also see if you server is handing out leases to the expected MAC
addresses.

Use TCPDUMP
-----------

If possible use ``tcpdump`` to inspect the network traffic on the DHCP
server [#tcpdump]_.  If you can gain root access to the DHCP server,
run the following ``tcpdump`` command to inspect the network traffic::

  dhcp-server:~ # tcpdump -v -e -i <intf> ether host <MAC address>

Replace <intf> with the network interface of the DHCP server that is
facing the target switch.  For example it might be 'eth0' or 'eth1'.

Replace <MAC address> with the MAC address of the target switch's
Ethernet management port.  You should be able to find the MAC address
on a label affixed to the outside of the switch.

Simplify DHCP Configuration
---------------------------

Try to trim down your DHCP configuration to the bare minimum.
Remember configuration within matching classes supersedes any global
scope configuration.

Add a Remote Syslog Server
--------------------------

ONIE can remotely log its progress to a ``syslog`` server.  If the DHCP
response contains a ``log-servers`` option, ONIE will remotely log to
that server.  Here is the ISC DHCP server syntax to specify a remote
syslog server::

  option log-servers 203.0.113.2;

Log In to the Target Switch
---------------------------

If you can determine that ONIE is getting an IP address from the DHCP
server (look at the DHCP leases file) you can remotely log in to the
target switch using ``ssh`` or ``telnet``::

  linux:$ ssh root@203.0.113.22
  The authenticity of host '203.0.113.22 (203.0.113.22)' can't be established.
  RSA key fingerprint is 15:05:64:8a:c6:f3:5f:65:41:a6:10:f6:9d:43:9c:49.
  Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
  Warning: Permanently added '203.0.113.22' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
  ONIE:~ # 

ONIE does not require a password for either ``ssh`` or ``telnet``.  Once
logged in you can inspect the ONIE log file ``/var/log/onie.log`` and
see what is happening::

  ONIE:~ # cat /var/log/onie.log 

Connect to the Serial Console
-----------------------------

If all else fails, you can connect to the serial console of the target
switch.  ONIE uses a baud rate of 115200.
