# Demonstration of the init-platform functionality

# This script fragment is sourced by /etc/init.d/init-arch.sh, which
# in turn executes the init_platform_pre_arch() and
# init_platform_post_arch() functions.

# A machine can use this feature to run any early boot scripts needed
# by the machine.  A typical usage would be to initialize specific
# hardware devices.

# Use this function to perform any initializations required by the
# architecture specific initialization.  This function executes before
# the architecture initializations.
