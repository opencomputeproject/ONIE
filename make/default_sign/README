This directory was created following directions from:
    https://wiki.debian.org/SettingUpSignedAptRepositoryWithReprepro

It contains a default GPG key to sign ONL packages, but because the
private key is public (distributed with the source!) it is really only
useful when doing private builds and there is a different chain of trust
(e.g., the person building the code is the same as the person installing
the code).  All official ONL binaries are signed using a different
(actually private) key.

The build scripts set $GNUPGHOME by default to
$ONL/make/default_sign/gnupg .  If you would like to sign the debs with
a different key, that is do an actually secure build, set $ONL_GNUPGHOME
to point to your own, valid keys, e.g., $HOME/.gnupg, before building.

Note that this unsafe key should never be added to your actual
/etc/apt.d/sources file -- it is only used during the build process.
